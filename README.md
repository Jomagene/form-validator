# Form Validator Project

Welcome to our Form Validator Project! Our goal is to create a user-friendly form that enhances the user experience through effective validation techniques. This project focuses on implementing a robust form that prompts the user for their username, email, and password, incorporating the following key features:

## Features
- **Field Validation:** Ensures no field is left unfilled, promoting a complete submission process.
- **Email Validation:** Implements format checking to confirm that the provided email addresses adhere to standard email formatting rules.
- **Password Validation:** Enforces password strength through length requirements and verifies that the password and confirmation password entries match for added security.

Our aim is to not only ensure the integrity of the data collected but also to provide users with immediate feedback on their input, thereby improving the overall user experience.
