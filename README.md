# form-validator
We're going to design a simple form that asks users for a username, email, and password. This form will have the following features: - Fields will be checked to ensure they aren’t left empty. - Email addresses will be validated to ensure they’re in a proper format. - Passwords will be validated for length and to ensure a confirm password matches.
